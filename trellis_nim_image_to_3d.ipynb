        "### 🚀 Official TRELLIS API Implementation\n",
        "This notebook now uses the **official NVIDIA TRELLIS NIM API format** from the documentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **TRELLIS Image-to-3D Mode**: Direct image processing with proper `mode`, `ss_sampling_steps`, and `slat_sampling_steps`\n",
        "- **TRELLIS Text-to-3D Mode**: Text prompts with TRELLIS-specific parameters\n",
        "- **Automatic variant detection**: Detects `base:text`, `large:text`, or `large:image` variants\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🛠️ Fixed Issues:\n",
        "✅ **\"Input type `image` is not supported\"** - Now uses correct TRELLIS API format  \n",
        "✅ **\"Argument list too long\"** - Uses temporary files for large payloads  \n",
        "✅ **Step 2 → Step 3 integration** - Seamless workflow connection  \n",
        "✅ **Official API compliance** - Matches NVIDIA documentation exactly  \n",
        "\n",
        "### To generate more 3D models from images:\n",
        "1. Upload a new image using Step 2\n",
        "2. Optionally change the `OUTPUT_FILE` and `SEED` in Step 3\n",
        "3. Run Step 3 - it will automatically choose the right mode\n",
        "\n",
        "### Tips for best results:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### For Image-to-3D containers:\n",
        "- Use images with clear, well-lit subjects\n",
        "- Objects with distinct shapes work better than complex scenes\n",
        "- Single objects tend to generate better 3D models than cluttered images\n",
        "\n",
        "#### For Text-to-3D containers (converted from images):\n",
        "- Use descriptive image filenames (e.g., \"red_sports_car.jpg\" vs \"IMG_1234.jpg\")\n",
        "- Edit the generated prompt for more specific results\n",
        "- Consider the 3D model purpose (decoration, 3D printing, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Image format support:\n",
        "- **Recommended**: PNG, JPG/JPEG\n",
        "- **Also supported**: BMP, TIFF, WebP\n",
        "- **Resolution**: Higher resolution images may produce better results\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 Upgrade Options:\n",
