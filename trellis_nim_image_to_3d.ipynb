        "#### For Text-to-3D containers (converted from images):\n",
        "- Use descriptive image filenames (e.g., \"red_sports_car.jpg\" vs \"IMG_1234.jpg\")\n",
        "- Edit the generated prompt for more specific results\n",
        "- Consider the 3D model purpose (decoration, 3D printing, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Image format support:\n",
        "- **Recommended**: PNG, JPG/JPEG\n",
        "- **Also supported**: BMP, TIFF, WebP\n",
        "- **Resolution**: Higher resolution images may produce better results\n",
